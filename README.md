## `Completed bonus tasks`

- [x] Conversations indicate unread messages
- [x] The application is fully responsive (especially with an open conversation sheet)
- [x] A more complex state management, ideally Redux, is used to manage the state of the application **(I consider `useReducer` as a replacement of `Redux`, which is too complex for the most of cases. The `reducer` function is the same.)**
- [x] The application can be launched as a desktop application using Electron or PWA **(electron app is lanuched as: `yarn electron`)**
- [x] The application contains tests (any). **(Tests are implemented in `Jest`: `yarn test`)**
- [x] Use of webpack and implementation of code splitting
